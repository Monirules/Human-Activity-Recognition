# Human Activity Recognition

This project uses machine learning and deep learning techniques to recognize human activities from sensor data. Models such as CNN, LSTM, and Federated Learning are employed to classify activities based on accelerometer and gyroscope data.

## Features:
- **Activity Classification**: Classify various human activities using sensor data.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Utilize CNN and LSTM models.
- **Federated Learning**: A privacy-preserving approach for model training.

## Tech Stack:
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn
- **Data**: Accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data
